# Mini-Spotify
You can browse artists, search for tracks, check trending playlists, play music etc.
### Prerequisites
In installation steps I will assume that you have installed NPM
### Installation
Create app with Create React App
```
npx create-react-app mini-spotify
```
In mini-spotify directory delete all files and directories except node-modules directory, then paste there everything from this repository, then run
```
npm install
```
And to start local server running app run
```
npm start
```
### Built (mainly) with
* React
* Redux
* Spotify Web API
* Bootstrap 4
First boot of this app may take some time because my free heroku server which handles Spotify Web API authentication will need to "wake up"
